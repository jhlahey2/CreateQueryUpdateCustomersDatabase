Create Query and Update the Customers Database

Part I
This assignment has a lot of steps. But I'll walk you through them. And after that you will be an SQL-Database Ninja.

Do you know what the most common database in business is? Think Excel. It seems every computer has a copy.
It seems everybody uses it. Most people use it for the wrong stuff. Despite that it often works.
In business, doing what works is more important than doing what's best.

In this exercise, you will be importing the data. Then you will follow a process that known as Normalizing the Database.
There are a million ways to normalize your database. You're going to import a spreadsheet full of data.
Then divide it into different tables. This is a realistic scenario. It plays out everyday throughout corporate America.
Clients send you data. The data is a mess. You need that data in a database.
Here are the steps we will follow

    Download the customer.csvPreview the document file
    Import the customers file into Workbench.Hint: Right-click on the database name and select table import option from the menu.
    Write a query to find the number of unique companies in the table.
    Create a new table for companies and move that data to the new table. Only move the unique companies.
    Then add a column to your customers table and update the the new column which is called CompanyID.
    Create a new table for cities and a new table for states and positions.
    Move that data to the new tables in the same way you did above. Move unique cities and unique states to the two new tables.
    Delete those columns from this table and add keys to link to the new tables.
    Create a query that recreates the original data set using joined tables.
    Export the data as SQL import statements (optional).

Submit your sql script but you don't have to submit the export file in #9.

Some help for you......
you want to move all the unique company names to another table
and then delete them from the customer table.
